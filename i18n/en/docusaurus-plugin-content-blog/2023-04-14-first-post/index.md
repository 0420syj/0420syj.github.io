It was a blog on GitHub.io, and it looked really pretty and easy to use.
And the footer of that blog said `~ Built with Docusaurus.`

## Creating a blog with Docusaurus 📝

I've used [Tistory](https://www.tistory.com/), [Velog](https://velog.io/), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), which are popular blogging platforms used by domestic developers, but there were many limitations when creating a blog.

To help more people create blogs, I wrote a simple guide to create a Docusaurus blog.
